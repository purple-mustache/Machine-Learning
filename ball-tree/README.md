# Ball Tree Algorithm

This is an algorithm predominantly used in KNN to reduce the size of the data for which we need to calculate the nearet neighbors. Although the accuracy is not impressive, the way the algorithm is built is very interesting


I implemented this algorithm as part of a school project so if you need to use a balltree algorithm, there is one that already exists on scikit-learn.

I will upload an example of how to use this algorithm sometime later.
